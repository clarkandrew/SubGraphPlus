  - Implemented proper Docker volume management instead of host directory mapping
  - Added container healthchecks to ensure proper service initialization sequence
  - Created dedicated Docker network for secure service communication

- **Docker Deployment**
  - Created comprehensive `docker-setup.sh` script for Docker environment management
  - Implemented proper container initialization with wait logic for dependencies
  - Added resource management and monitoring support
  - Fixed issues with Docker data persistence and container restart policies

- **Dockerfile Enhancements**
  - Added proper initialization sequence with entrypoint script
  - Improved dependency installation with additional necessary packages
  - Created database initialization within container build process
  - Added better error handling and fallback mechanisms when services are unavailable

## Testing and Operational Improvements

- **Test Fixes**
  - Fixed authentication handling in test files to use correct configuration paths
  - Updated function patching to target correct module paths
  - Added better error handling in test functions
  - Fixed potential concurrency issues in tests

- **Benchmark Enhancements**
  - Improved error handling for empty datasets when calculating metrics
  - Added better dependency handling for HTML report generation
  - Implemented robust error checking for visualization functions
  - Added fallback mechanisms when optional dependencies are missing

- **Backup & Restore**
  - Enhanced error handling in backup/restore scripts
  - Added Docker-aware operation with graceful degradation
  - Improved container detection and connection
  - Added comprehensive error reporting and success/failure tracking

## Usability Enhancements

- **Shell Scripts**
  - Created `demo.sh` for interactive system demonstration
  - Created `make-executable.sh` to ensure all scripts are executable
  - Updated existing scripts with better error handling and environment detection
  - Added proper documentation within scripts for easier understanding

- **Documentation**
  - Created comprehensive deployment guide (`DEPLOYMENT.md`)
  - Updated README.md with clear Docker-first approach
  - Added detailed configuration instructions for both Docker and local environments
  - Documented common tasks and troubleshooting procedures
  - Created detailed security recommendations

- **Configuration**
  - Ensured all default configurations are created during initialization
  - Added environment variable overrides for key settings
  - Implemented fallback mechanisms for missing configurations
  - Added validation to prevent common misconfigurations

## Security Enhancements

- **Authentication & Authorization**
  - Fixed issues with API key authentication handling
  - Improved error messages for authentication failures
  - Added proper isolation between containers

- **Data Protection**
  - Implemented volume-based data persistence for better security
  - Added backup functionality with proper error handling
  - Improved error logging with sanitized outputs
  - Enhanced configuration security through environment variables

## Cleanup & Best Practices

- **Code Organization**
  - Enhanced .gitignore to prevent accidental commits of sensitive or temporary files
  - Fixed path handling to be consistent across Docker and local environments
  - Added proper entrypoint scripting for containers
  - Ensured all scripts follow best practices for error handling and user feedback

- **Operational Readiness**
  - Added comprehensive monitoring endpoints with proper healthchecks
  - Implemented production-ready Docker Compose configurations
  - Added resource usage monitoring capabilities
  - Documented scaling approaches for production environments

## Conclusion
