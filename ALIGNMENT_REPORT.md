## Open Questions

1. **MLP Model Distribution**: How should the pre-trained SubgraphRAG MLP model be distributed? Current implementation has placeholder creation.

2. **Production Secrets Management**: Should we integrate with external secret management systems (Vault, K8s secrets) for the MVP?

3. **FAISS Index Training**: Should we implement automatic retraining triggers based on data volume thresholds?

4. **Performance Benchmarks**: What are the acceptable latency targets for the p95 requirement (currently 5s)?

## Critical Gaps Requiring Immediate Attention

1. **Demo Script Path**: Makefile references incorrect path for demo_quickstart script
2. **MLP Model Acquisition**: Need proper script for downloading/training MLP model
3. **FAISS Training**: Index training uses random data instead of real embeddings
4. **Token Budget**: greedy_connect_v2 needs proper token counting enforcement

## Recommendations

### High Priority (Complete for MVP)
1. Fix demo_quickstart script path in Makefile
2. Implement proper MLP model acquisition with fallback instructions
3. Add real data training for FAISS index
4. Enhance token budget enforcement

### Medium Priority (Nice to Have)
1. Add D3.js visualization demo
2. Generate OpenAPI specification
3. Add performance tuning documentation
4. Implement advanced monitoring

### Low Priority (Post-MVP)
1. Multi-tenant support design
2. Advanced secret management integration
3. Comprehensive deployment pipeline
4. Video demo recording

## Conclusion

The implementation demonstrates strong technical competency and exceeds specifications in several areas (testing, documentation, CI/CD). The core SubgraphRAG+ functionality is well-implemented with proper abstractions and error handling. The remaining gaps are primarily in operational concerns and final deliverables rather than core functionality.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with addressing critical gaps while maintaining the high quality of the existing implementation.
